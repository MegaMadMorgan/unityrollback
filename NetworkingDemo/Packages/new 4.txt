-Determinism
-Independant Simulation
-Serialization

Game needs to have same outcome every time when given a series of inputs (can't use Unity physics / float values)

Must be able to step/update game states multiple times during a frame without rendering graphics or sampling input (easier to do from start so game logic can be seperate)
Must be able to "predict" input from remote player when we do not have current information

Must be able to save and load gamestates at any time, so that we can "rollback" when a prediction was incorrect.
